                        <p className='textbox'>Brandi has been practicing and perfecting cosmetology professionally for over six years. It all started when she was three years old and her dad was supposed to be babysitting. A pair of scissors and a few minutes later, all the barbies, along with Brandiâ€™s own head of hair, showed her passion and creativity with the beauty industry!
                        The summer before her senior year of high school, Brandi started cosmetology school at MATC.
                        She graduated both hair school and high school around the same time, and jumped right into a salon. Over the years, Brandi has grown a love for menâ€™s cuts, undercuts and foiling. As well as blondes, extensions and facial waxing. Brandi uses the brands Kevin Murphy, Keune and Redken along with many others to aid her in achieving the look each individual client is going for.
                        Brandi has been at Salon Beleza for four years. She works part time in the salon doing hair, and full time outside the salon raising two wild redheads. Along with raising two kids, Brandi enjoys the outdoors, the small farm her and her husband have created, and bing watching Netflix with popcorn and Cadbury eggs.
